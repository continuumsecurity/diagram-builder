### Group Node can have children
Group Node can have children. These children will be moved alongside the group node
````java
Node node1 = new Node(name, "task1", 0, 0, width, height);
Node node2 = new Node(name, "task2", 0, 0, width, height);
Node node = new Node(name, "task", 0, 0, width, height);
node.setChildren(new ArrayList(){"task1", "task2"});
````

### Enables/Disables delete by key stroke and hides/shows delete button
Enables/Disables the key stroke for delete and hides/shows the button to delete when
the user clicks in a node.
```Java
DiagramBuilder diagramBuilder = new DiagramBuilder();
diagramBuilder.setShowDeleteNodeIcon(false);
diagramBuilder.setEnableDeleteByKeyStroke(false);
```

### Upgrade Vaadin version from 7.6.1 to 8.5.2
Continuum security use Vaadin 8.5.2 and some errors were spotted using an older version, so we decided to update from
vaadin 7 to 8 since release [1.4.1](https://github.com/continuumsecurity/diagram-builder/releases/tag/1.4.1)
To use the previous version with vaadin 7 support pick the release [1.4.0](https://github.com/continuumsecurity/diagram-builder/releases/tag/1.4.0)

### Upgrade Vaadin version from 7.2.0.beta1 to 7.6.1
Continuum security use Vaadin 7.6.1 and some errors were spotted when using an older version

### Adds MouseOver custom function call over Transition
Integrate MouseOver custom function call with Alloy-UI diagram-builder component when
user mouse move over transition

```Java
diagramBuilder.addTransitionMouseMoveListener(new DiagramBuilder.TransitionMouseMoveListener() {
    @Override
    void move(String connectorName, DiagramBuilder.EventType eventType, Double top, Double left) {

    }
});
```

### Show/Hide Transition node Name
Option to show/hide the Transition Name
```Java
Transition transition = new Transition(source, target, name);
transition.connector.setShowName(false);
```

### Custom Height/Width for Task and Group
Option to set the height/width of tasks and groups
```Java
int height = 400;
int width = 200
Node node = new Node(name, "task", 0, 0, width, height);
```

### Enable/Disable User Interface Tasks linking
Option to enable/disable the tasks from the User Interface
```Java
Node node = new Node(name, "task", 0, 0, 100, 100);
node.setAllowsLinking(false);
```
